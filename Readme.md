## Backend for AngularJSTodoApp & IonicTodoApp

This reposistory contains the source code that makes up the Backend
for [AngularJSTodoApp](https://github.com/jaylenw/AngularJsTodoApp), [IonicTodoApp](https://github.com/jaylenw/IonicTodoApp), and [ElectronTodoApp](https://github.com/jaylenw/ElectronTodoApp).

Installation instructions on this backend are found below and also on the
on the projects' repo linked above.

## Build

1. Need to have [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), installed on your system globally. If running a Debian/Ubuntu system and you do not have the packages installed globally, run these commands below:

        sudo apt update  
        sudo curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -
        sudo apt install nodejs  
        sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node
        sudo npm install forever -g

2. Clone this repo.

3. In the root of the project folder, run `npm install`.

4. Next, install mongodb on your system globally and have it running. If on a Ubuntu/Debian system, you would run
   `sudo apt install mongodb`.

## Testing

1. Run `./scripts/test.sh` to run the unit tests for Nota.

2. After running the tests, you will see a coverage summary of the tests informing
you what tests passed or not.

3. You may also open `coverage/nota/index.html` file to see a break down of coverage
for every file in a report.

4. Running the unit tests and having everything passing is an excellent indicator
that your system has all the dependencies installed.

5. You may click on the coverage badge above in this README to see the difference
in coverage with changes that have made in already pushed branches.

6. Running the test script will create the database and drop it once tests are
complete.

7. The 422 Bad response error is not related to Nota. It's an error that occurs
when the tests are not ran on Travis-CI.

## Development

1. Run `./scripts/development.sh` to start the server in development mode.

2. Running the server in development mode is useful for testing Nota manually.

3. If not already existing, this will create a development database for Nota.

4. You will see output to the console in this mode.

5. Kill the server by using CTRL-C.

6. If you want a clean run of the server again, be sure to drop the development
database manually.

7. In the `Postman` directory, you may use the files in there to import a working
collection and environment to test out the APIs of Nota. [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) is a great API testing software for testing out this backend.

8. [Robomongo / Robo 3T](https://robomongo.org/) is an awesome way to manage your
MongoDB databases.

## Production

1. Run `./scripts/production.sh` to start the server. The script calls `forever` to start and
monitor the server.

2. If you need to kill `forever` for any reasons, run `forever list`. You will then see a list of all `forever` processes. Kill the `forever` process you want
by identifying the `pid` and killing it by running `forever stop pidNUM` where pidNUM is the pid number is the process you would like to kill.

3. By default, the server will be listening on port 3000.

4. [Forever](https://www.npmjs.com/package/forever) makes sure a node application stays
running if something were to cause it to be killed.

5. If you want, when deploying to a server, use [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) as a proxy in front of Nota. There are many benefits of doing so.

### Note

If you ever encounter MongoDB being locked and is returning no response to Nota,
run these commands below.
```
sudo rm /var/lib/mongodb/mongod.lock
mongod --repair
sudo service mongodb start
```

# Routes

This backend allows the user to register, login, logout, create tasks, retrieve tasks, edit tasks, and delete tasks.

Pull request and issues are welcomed. Please make sure you are able to run the
unit tests with all passing before raising a PR. Add or modify unit tests sensibly
if needed. As well, be descriptive in your PR description. Thank you! :)
